		<section>
			<h1 class="overview">In 2019, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a new online registration system for the 2021 H-1B cap season.</h1>
			<p>The H-1B is a nonimmigrant visa that enables employers to hire highly skilled foreign workers. Each year, employers submit petitions to a lottery where 
				approximately 50% are randomly selected to be adjudicated. Rather than investing significant cost and effort upfront, USCIS proposed a new system where 
				employers will first register for the lottery and then submit a petition if selected. </p>
			<p>As a product designer on myUSCIS, the online platform for filing immigration benefits, I was tasked to design the end-to-end experience for the H-1B registration.</p>

		<h2 class="header-background">Discovery</h2>
		<section>
			<p>The H-1B registration introduced two new user groups to the myUSCIS product: employment-based attorneys and employers. I partnered with our researcher to plan 
				and facilitate contextual inquiries with attorneys. We discovered that employment-based attorneys organized cases by benefits, prioritized work by deadlines, 
				and collaborated in teams with multiple roles. </p>
			<p>I lead the creation of the research artifacts: archetypes, user journey map, and a future state H-1B blueprint to visualize key touchpoints USCIS communication and 
				training initiatives.</p>

			<p>Since communication prior to the registration period would be critical to shaping their expectations and mental model, I tailored and shared findings on user roles, 
				requirements and timeline to USCIS public engagement teams.</p>

		<h2 class="header-background">Design</h2>
		<section>
			<p>I facilitated a kickoff with the team to define goals, requirements, project plan, and measurable outcomes. While the H-1B working group translated policy into 
				feature requirements, I created several user and process flows to map high-level sequence of tasks and interactions and align myUSCIS with external stakeholders. </p>

			<p>Using the existing design system,  I built and iterated on wireframes for the account, filing, and case management stages of the experience, identifying where the 
				registration posed unique design challenges and surfaced potential global enhancements. </p>
		</section>
		<h2 class="header-background">Usability Testing </h2>
		<section>
			<p>I lead two rounds of usability testing and engaged the whole team by inviting along as note-takers. Then, I facilitated a workshop where we sorted the findings along a 
				value and effort matrix and ideated on the issues identified for MVP. </p>

		<h2 class="header-background">Development</h2>
		<section>
			<p>As an embedded designer on a development team, I supported implementation of the in 2-week sprints for several months through sprint planning, groomings, and desk checks. 
				Requirements continuously shifted with USCIS policy and dependencies on external systems, so I worked closely with our business analyst and product manager to prioritize 
				features in the backlog and revise design and copy. </p>
		</section>
		<h2 class="header-background">Retrospective</h2>
		<section>
			<p>My role on myUSCIS marked my first time designing as the sole designer on a scrum team. I learned how to operate 2 week sprint cycles and communicate with developers. 
				I gained a better understanding of how developers thought and incorporated timing, edge cases, and various states (i.e. empty and loading) into my design process.
